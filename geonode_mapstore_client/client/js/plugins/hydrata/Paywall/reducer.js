/**
 * Paywall reducer (TASK-2099, epic 2092 W4.1). Mounted at state.anuga.paywall
 * (see Anuga/reducersAnuga.js) — the paywall block is per-project, keyed off
 * the same Anuga project context as everything else in that tree.
 *
 * Two-layer shape:
 *   steady  — the last `paywall` block from my_perms (free_public /
 *             paid_private / past_due). Written by SET_ANUGA_RESOURCE_PERMS.
 *   overlay — FE-only ephemeral state my_perms never emits (upgrade_prompt,
 *             pending). Takes precedence over `steady` while set.
 *
 * getEffectivePaywallPayload resolves the two into the single payload shape
 * PaywallPanel expects ({state, checkout_url, read_only}).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: SET_ANUGA_RESOURCE_PERMS's payload also contains `my_role`,
 * `visibility`, and per-resource-type perms dicts — Anuga/reducers/
 * resourcesReducer.js's generic merge loop must SKIP the `paywall` key (it is
 * an object, not an {id: perms} map, so without an explicit skip it silently
 * corrupts into resources.paywall = []). See _NON_RESOURCE_KEYS there.

 * The steady literals that mean "the subscription landed" — i.e. the pending

 *
 * TASK-2457 (adversarial R2, epic 2425 W2.5): this was the bare string
 * 'paid_private'. `paid_organization` — the state W2 itself added — never
 * matched, so a customer WHO HAD PAID sat on a permanent, undismissable
 * "Confirming your subscription…" until they reloaded.
 *
 * The contract doc had retracted this finding on the grounds that the webhook
 * (commerce/checkout_views.py) hardcodes the flip to PRIVATE, so paid_private
 * always matches. That is true for the checkout path and false as a general
 * claim: this clear runs on EVERY my_perms read, not only post-checkout, and
 * an already-organization project on an entitled account reads back
 * paid_organization. Derive from the list, never re-inline a literal.
